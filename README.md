## ReactJS CRUD App

[Demo](https://alexandr-bbm.github.io/react-crud/)

### Description
Simple ReactJS application for client-side create, read, update and delete entries.

### Features
* Material UI
* Form validation
* Filter
* Extensible and embeddable

### Development
1. Clone the repo.
2. Install node modules: `npm i`.
3. Then launch webpack in watch mode by `npm run dev`.
4. Open `index.html` (I didn't use hot reload in this project, so dev server is not configured by default).
